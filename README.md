# E-Commerce-Back-End-Object-Relational-Mapping

## Objective
The purpose of this activity is to complete the back end for an e-commerce site using Express.js and MySQL in order to track items within a database. The object is to be able to implement our data using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests within Insomnia. 

## Criteria
* When I log into MySQL then I am connected the database. 
* When I run the "npm run seed" command, then the database is seeded with my data. 
* When I open up my terminal and run the "npm start" command, then I am instantly connected to Insomnia. 
* When I do an api GET command for my category, product, and tag routes, then data for the each of these routes is displayed. 
* When I test the routes with POST, PUT, and DELETE, I am able to successfully create, update, or remove items in my database.
